It was conducted as a loosely structured BoF-style event. The following parties were present at the summit (in no particular order):
Distros / Entities: Ubuntu Core, Debian, GNOME OS, Fedora CoreOS, Endless OS, Arch Linux, SUSE, Flatcar, Microsoft, Amazon, Meta Projects: systemd, image-builder/osbuild, mkosi, tpm2-software, System Transparency, buildstream, BTRFS, rpm-ostree Actionables and tasks # Action items listed here can be found as TODO #[x] in the full meeting minutes below, with [x] being the action item number.
Provide feedback to the proposal for systemd-syscfg Propose spec for application configuration file search path order to evangelise to application builders. Extend xdg_base specification to specify order (first to last): /run , then /etc , then /usr/etc use /usr/share/factory for vendor defaults, apps should never look there Let users override the above, e.g. via env vars (e.g. add /usr/local/…) Extend UKI to support allow-list of kernel command line parameters, or env var-like file allow sd-stub to pick up new cmdline via files, make shim verify it (via MoK), and consume it Add support for UKI booting to Grub. E.g. Grub module that loads a UKI and jumps into the kernel. Grub already has PE parser 4a. TODO sd-boot: Support type 1 entry that references type 2 + own kernel command line options Missing mkosi features: make sysext, UKI builds fully reproducible. calculate the signature server side, rebuild locally and apply (to make sig optional in case of legacy / non-UEFI system) support iso9660 - tracked here, also see TODO 10 switch to systemd-repart for unprivileged image builds, tracked here SPDX manifest file TODO 17 Extend Discoverable Partitions Specification to add policy language to restrict what the initrd will load from the disk allow recovery partition GUID allow discovery subvolumes/inode (BTRFS) Add versioning of resources to sysext / UKI spec. Use RPM versioning format. Auto-detect versioned resources by means of version prefix in sub-directories: ./foo.a/ has image(s) for resource foo version a (with a following RPM versioning format) ./foo.b/ has image(s) for resource foo version b (Flatcar team) Add support for boot-complete.target to signal \u0026ldquo;healthy boot\u0026rdquo;. Flatcar uses non-standard update_engine.service for the same. Tracked in Flatcar #865 Systemd boot-complete.target: add optional timer that fails if target is not reached within timeout, triggering a reboot, in turn triggering a rollback. Support in systemd-repart for optionally removing outdated partitions to free up space. MBR iso9660 (will also address part of TODO 5) Systemd to provide / standardise on a common target that means, after this is reached, root fs has been resized/reparted/etc and it is fully writable and ready initrd-root-fs.target already exists for the initrd stage local-fs-pre.target ? or new target? https://github.com/systemd/systemd/pull/24680 Standardise UEFI environment for systemd-repart to trigger full / partial reset. Also define a systemd target to reboot into for factory reset (full or partial) for interactive / desktop systems to offer on a boot menu Add support to repart for full repartitioning (full factory reset) if the disk UUID was set to 0xFFFF… (similar to existing support for partition factory reset on UUID 00000…) To handle app config, add support to systemd-tempfiles for removing files in factory reset mode - tracked here Discoverable Partition Spec: add specifications for partition flags to indicate the partition\u0026rsquo;s purpose (e.g. boot, sysext, recovery, etc.) systemd-sysupdate would ignore recovery partitions and not consider these part of an A/B update scheme systemd-sysupdate, systemd boot: add protection against unwanted roll-back (downgrade attack) by use of TPM counters. Add support for secure boot SBAT csv of images embedded in UKI, add SBAT csv to verity signature in DDI discover part mkinitcpio already implements objcopy functions which could be reused systemd-sysupdate download helper to become ‘pluggable’, so casync or other can be used instead of the built-in downloader (http). Add SPDX/SBOM field in os-release that points to local file or URL TODO #17 Enhance either cryptsetup or systemd-cryptsetup to support Shamir Secret Sharing and combine multiple tokens/slots Meeting minutes # OS images and integrity # UKI (unified kernel image): a new kernel/initrd format
limited to 4GB to fit into EFI space Secure, immutable, all in a single file (easy to update) Baked-in initrd, cmdline, root credentials (signed list of TPM PCR 11 values, key that signs the list) simplified storage of OS secrets, like disk encryption keys, making updates less brittle Credentials stored in the ESP, together with the UKI, are also gathered and passed to the booted system wrapped in a PE file, signed for UEFI Secure Boot There is a Red Hat feature request to allow multiple kernel cmdline in a single UKI, bootloader generates menu based on that (eg: debug mode, safe mode, etc.) Lack of bootloader-passed, custom command line could create issues later. TODO #3 to fix this. Root fs: UKI cmdline can have verity roothash, credentials can extended that
UKIs enable both secure boot and TPM based security, independently
The TPM-based story for UKIs gives stronger guarantees than just Secure Boot, by allowing to express/attach policies to specific kernes/UKIs.
grub lacks support for UKI. TODO #4 to fix that.
would limit future flexibility in UKIs though (e.g. custom logic) since Grub would then need to support that, too Initrd is generated via mkosi
https://github.com/systemd/mkosi-initrd LPC presentation slides LPC presentation recording Layered initrd, signed/read-only/measured, built server-side and deployed and loaded on demand Base initrd in UKI works on most systems, is extendable via sysext (e.g. optional support for hardware) mkosi-initrd can build base and layers from packages only Some work is ongoing on dracut to support this, in a hybrid mode where it builds the initrd/extensions from dracut modules, but no dracut runtime logic on the running system Problem: size constraints for existing systems, that have to be supported Documentation on pre-calculated and signed PCR values:
Unrendered measure manpage, updated quickly Rendered measure manpage, may be outdated Unrendered stub manpage, updated quickly Rendered stub manpage, may be outdated UKI might be proposed for Fedora 39
Sysext initrd extensions will be shipped in RPMs Sysext, UKI not fully reproducible, see TODO #5 Discoverable Partitions Specification
Please file PRs to extend the specification to systemd\u0026rsquo;s repository Input collected in Summit see TODO #6 DDI: Discoverable Disk Image, uses DPS and signed dm-verity. Inspired by Canonical\u0026rsquo;s Snaps, uses the same technique and builds on top of it. Distro-independent sysext images? Vision: Kubernetes project can publish their own Kubernetes sysext, runs well on all distros, is self-updating client side, so Kubernetes upstream can keep it up to date just by publishing new versions.
Could be done by promoting building tools for Go/Rust static binaries. Flatcar has a lab / playground for this, for example for Docker. mkosi to build UKIs, DDIs etc.. python based
configured via .ini plus drop-ins supports dm-verity, SecureBoot, Signatures, PCR measurement for building UKIs, DDIs, sysext, initrd, OS images (w/ split partition support for individual partition update images)
Produces manifest file with list of packages that were installed (SBOM) Does not support SLSA Native support on OBS Open Build Service Some features missing like reproducible builds, iso9660, switching to systemd-repart, see TODO 5 WIP: unprivileged builds, but dracut still needs root (run nspawn in image), BTRFS too Fedora CoreOS uses a small VM to handle partitioning / fill partitions w/o privileges, circumventing the above rpm-ostree + coreos-assembler can build images (kind-of-images as you can put them into a container image / convert to something else), see https://github.com/coreos/rpm-ostree, https://github.com/coreos/coreos-assembler
osbuild
Endless: OSTree built with eos-ostree-builder - private repo, but deb-ostree-builder is similar – and GPT disk images with eos-image-builder
KIWI https://github.com/OSInside/kiwi
Flatcar uses custom python script inherited from CoreOS, always builds images from sources (Gentoo style)
Adds SLSA provenance (sources fingerprints -\u0026gt; binaries fingerprints) to OS image during build. Need to standardize on a common target that means, after this is reached, root fs has been resized/reparted/etc and it is fully writable and ready - see TODO #11
Novel Linux file system technology for immutable OS images (blobfs, …)
composefs RPM-backed images, e.g. using btrfs reflinks (rpm2extents) or FUSE (repomount) Blobfs ( Fuchsia) simple FS that only allows git-like object store. Add object, get hash back No Linux support No inodes/filenames/dentries/attributes/access modes/timestamps/directories verity-protected, de-duplicated by default, garbage collection Simple enough to be accessed from firmware too Would enable use of single partition instead of A/B, could be added to the bottom of GPT and grow at the front. Pool of images - DDIs/UKIs or anything else - available everywhere with implicit and automatic trust in that partition.
Handling user configuration changes # systemd already supports /usr/share/factory/ and specifiers in tmpfiles.d to populate /etc/ from there
Other projects (ostree, libeconf) populate from /usr/etc/
Some other projects use a 3-way merge of configurations in /etc/
Previous version default config Previous version w/ user changes New version default config Merging of configurations? PAM as a negative example w/ single-line changes
Red Hat works around this by abstracting PAM into features (coarse application support), Debian has a more fine-grained (but manual) merge tool. PAM future: serve a static configuration and provide an API for dynamic / user defined changes PAM is just one example, glibc\u0026rsquo;s nss-switch is another
OSTree copies from /usr/etc/ to /etc/ at first boot
On update, new configs are copied, user changes remain untouched (== config merge in per-file granularity) OpenSUSE uses the libeconf project, and MicroOS uses BTRFS snapshots: when a new snapshot is created, chroot into it and run the rpm scriptlets, then makes it read-only. User modifications are done via OverlayFS and stored in /var, which is outside the snapshot.
Programs could forward-convert config via ExecStartPre that figures out config differences semantically
sshd has ssh-keygen for example Not fully adopted on all distros for first boot generation needs buy-in of each project to ship such tool User management: Fedora has started moving away from /etc/passwd and /etc/group to systemd-sysusers
systemd project just published syscfg proposal, see TODO #1
Core concept is that even for configuration, one can always trace any file back to its source in a cryptographically secure way Could systemd-syscfg look at configuration-release SYSCFG_LEVEL= and make sure it matches /usr/\u0026rsquo;s SYSCFG_LEVEL=, and find the right image, or refuse a wrong one? Add sliding window for version support, on top of \`==\`\` systemd-repart will be able to build syscfg DDIs, should be multi-call (call as e.g. systemd-makesyscfg build config DDI) long term, systemd sysext aims to use /etc/ as immutable / service factory default stack of configuration images and /etc/local/ as local user modifications.
distinguish between verified, secure config and binaries make node state cryptographically deterministic and only deploy workloads if we can prove a node to run trusted binaries in a trusted configuration tie a specific configuration to a specific time window, which allows e.g. a secret to be unlocked only in a given week and not afterwards syscfg rollback: how to do it at system level?
At service level (ConfigurationImages=) it’s easier as there’s a single one that has a clear signal on reload At system level problem is combinatorial explosion, could try with counters - each config image has a counter, start with highest and count down Also needs rollback protection, idea: TPM2 monotonic counter establishes (sliding) range window of allowed versions TODO #2: establish spec for search path order, to at least try to push applications, extend xdg_base specification to specify order as (first to last). See details there.
/run/ -\u0026gt; /etc/ -\u0026gt; /usr/etc/, /usr/share/factory/ for vendor mask, override, etc. OSTree uses /usr/etc/ and /etc/, prefers local (/etc/) files in case of conflicts
enforces reboots after config changes Some distros address this at packaging level, push package maintainers to default to /usr/etc/
UsrEtc on SUSE credential handling in /etc/: systemd-credentials can inject sensitive information into system services
secrets are encrypted using TPMs, and only decrypted on demand immediately before consumption meant as a replacement for passing creds in env variables exposes secrets as files Updating OS Images and overlays # Prior Art # Build/deploy: can we learn from OCI? Current OCI users use tarballs and merge them, no offline/online security OCI layers are linear and one way merge Fedora IoT / RHEL 4 Edge uses Greenboot During meeting Greenboot was nudged to use boot-complete SUSE has openSUSE Health-checker Ubuntu has a health check too GNOME OS nudge to use boot-complete Endless OS has rudimentary check, \u0026ldquo;did a user GNOME session start? If so, grub-editenv - unset recordfail\u0026rdquo;) Future Developments # systemd-repart: declarative configuration of system partitions, can populate systems with files too, cryptographically secure
runs in initrd, \u0026ldquo;magic tar for creating system layout\u0026rdquo; can build images, too (DDI - Discoverable Disk Image) Supports GPT Some features missing, see TODO #10 Automatic boot assessment after update to mark partition/disk/whatever as good/bad
Specification Systemd provides boot-complete.target to signal \u0026ldquo;boot is healthy\u0026rdquo; TODO #8: Add support to Flatcar Already hooked up with sd-boot Make this target depend on health test / critical service units There is one test shipped by upstream that checks for no failed services, but is likely too broad as some services should be allowed to fail TODO #9: add optional timer that fails if nothing happens within time, triggering reboot / rollback General A/B booting, versioning # Prior Art # grub vs. sd-boot legacy hardware / non-EFI access to filesystems in grub shim only supports grub (signature) as bootloader for secure boot currently Issue could be mitigated if grub could boot UKIs Using partitions vs. putting fs images into writable space OS (initrd) would need to trust FS used for writable space but since space is writable, FS exploits can be staged there, tainting the FS OS, when booting, mounts tainted FS to get access to OS FS images stored there, and chain of trust is broken Chromebook/Android Work in progress for (rpm-)ostree based systems to establish trust in the partition content State of the \u0026ldquo;custom/partial\u0026rdquo; BLS support in Fedora Support for fallback in Shim/grub Pull request Used mostly for updating shim itself Non-EFI platforms? See TODO #4 Grub UKI support SteamOS EFI loader Uses a \u0026ldquo;A\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;B\u0026rdquo; partition labels RAUC Embedded updater, with A/B slots, integrates with many bootloaders/filesystems Future Developments # Concept: flag partition after booting, good/bad, fallback sd-boot adds counters to UKI filename, uses counters for ordering in the menu for default entry More generally, any resource (sysext or UKI) could be versioned with two counters e.g.: nspawn --image=/path/some/directory/ picks the image from that directory based on counters Version format is modified RPM version format Directory suffix to signal that a directory organizes objects with this version specification inside. e.g.: ./foo.a/ has image(s) for resource foo version a (with a following RPM versioning format) ./foo.b/ has image(s) for resource foo version b TODO #7: add to sysext spec TODO #10: repart remove old / outdated partition that is not useful anymore Problem: usr/root partition is fixed after initial boot and repartition TPM provisioning, enrolling, measurement, remote attestation # Set up a Linux PCR registry, with a public list of which project claims which PCR, to allow vendor-independent coordination Keylime is used in SUSE Measures using IMA hashes Initrd measured twice Fedora CoreOS also looking into keylime for on boot remote attestation DICE as a reference architecture TCG specification Documentation from Microsoft OS factory reset # Prior Art # Fedora CoreOS has a WIP tracking issue to support factory reset Endless OS currently just erases users \u0026amp; data, implemented as enabling a systemd service for next boot which disables itself once run Flatcar uses a flag file in the ESP which is picked up and acted on by Ignition in the initrd, causing re-deployment of user config Ubuntu core supports reset via recovery partition (image file in ESP) SUSE MicroOS keeps BTRFS snapshot #1 around, and it can be selected from cli or bootloader menu Future Developments # Full reset vs. selectively keeping wanted local data Selective reset would allow reconfiguration for OSes which apply config at provisioning time (Flatcar, FCOS). large downloads (e.g.container images, databases) would remain while config could be updated benefit over using configuration management (Chef, Ansible) is that deployments remain idempotent, no config drift TODO #12 has a sub-item to add support for removing files to systemd-tmpfiles to better support partial reset systemd-repart can mark a partition for factory reset, will re-initialise / clear those parts first, then continue boot Reset is triggered by an UEFI variable - in repart, but other systems use different ways (see below). TODO #12 tracks standardising on reset. Also align on high-level target to reboot into, so desktops can provide menu to request factory reset Repart also supports filling the partition if the UUID is set to 0000… Add the same for 0xFFFFF to signal full factory reset (full repartitioning) for the disk GPT How to restore factory config, and apps stored outside the OS image? Tmpfiles support for removing stuff only on factory reset mode - tracked here Handling recovery partitions (Ubuntu core) Image could be updated but usually isn’t (security vs. robustness) TODO #13 update Discoverable Partition Spec to define flags indicating purpose (boot, sysext, recovery). sysupdate would not consider recovery partitions in A/B update scheme. Distributing OS images # Prior Art # rpm-ostree builds OS images on the server side and distributes the resulting tree
Optionally, a new layer can be built locally and overlaid on the base When the base image is updated then the local build + overlay are repeated Multiple transport channels are supported, e.g. static website (with static deltas, or individual object pulls, similar to Git). container registry Initial installation uses image from (Live) ISO (w/ installer for automation), but image can also be dded to disk directly 3 release streams, user chooses which stream to follow Endless OS
initial install is from GPT disk image dded to disk updates are ostree images, composed server-side from debs. No local layering (like rpm-ostree does) Transport channel is static HTTP Clients fetch a delta from current revision, if available on server; otherwise, missing files are pulled individually Ubuntu core distributes a filesystem image that can be dded to disk
Everything is shipped as snaps (in squashfs images) on boot, writable space contains 1 or more versions of base OS squashfs, \u0026ldquo;current\u0026rdquo; / \u0026ldquo;good\u0026rdquo; one is mounted on /. Apps are snaps too, mounted similarly. Xdelta for image (snaps) updates Transport channel is http with proprietary server side supports detached signatures based on hashes of snaps Xdelta deals with squashfs mostly fine, deltas are created on-demand server-side Flatcar: initial provisioning is full image, via cloud store / marketplace or manual download from image server (https). Image contains full partition layout; root partition is extended during provisioning to fill whole disk
Flatcar updates are full images, no delta. Combined kernel+initrd+OS partition, all signed Update from any version to any other. Updates are orchestrated using the Omaha protocol, (Chrome OS update protocol) Omaha is a \u0026ldquo;control plane\u0026rdquo; layer on top of transports; clients poll for update Allows controlled roll-out (only X clients at the same time) Feedback channel from client to server, so server \u0026ldquo;knows\u0026rdquo; how many clients succeeded / failed. Roll-out can be stopped if too many clients fail \u0026ldquo;update succeeded\u0026rdquo; uses \u0026ldquo;boot succeeded\u0026rdquo; semantics, i.e. user-defined system critical service units must start successfully, else update failed Implemented in Nebraska server, is FOSS Update transport channel is HTTPS, but Nebraska is transport agnostic and could serve any URIs Flatcar offers 4 distinct channels: Alpha (developer), Beta (production-ready, for canaries) and Stable. LTS is a \u0026ldquo;golden stable\u0026rdquo; that receives only patch updates for 18 months. Patch releases go directly to each channel, new major releases are stabilised via Alpha -\u0026gt; Beta -\u0026gt; Stable transition Future Developments # Systemd-sysupdate
Is an updater for DDIs, but could also do directory trees. Command line tool to apply updates. Information on how to update is inside the images themselves Point sysupdate to the image, and it will be updated if needed (current version lower than image) Built around lists of objects, version compared Manifest of object store server-side as sha512 sums file Compares version of what’s local, and what’s on the server, and gets right thing Will be able to use casync as transport, which chunks an image (like zsync) into files (unlike zsync). Hence zsync needs http range requests server-side, casync does not. Configurable chunk/block size; download size vs granularity trade-off left to owner/user Giant pile of files (== individual chunks) on server, to be CDN-friendly Always reconstruct target from seed, ideally could be used for backups (e.g.: homed) Idea: create a TPM signed report which includes manifest for images, and also metadata about node itself (PSI etc), orchestrator collects these from nodes on a timer and produces credential that can only be decrypted by that specific node in that specific state sysupdate transport is built-in (http) but should be pluggable - see TODO #16 TPM counters could be used to guard against unwanted rollbacks (downgrade attack).
To still allow regular rollback,sliding window of allowed counter values could be used Counters can only go up, need root to change. TPM can be reset by root, but lose all keys. Updating moves window forward. Systemd at boot will bump counter, with graceful fallback in case counters do not work/not available Vendors increase upper end on new release, increase lower end when cutting out older release Signed PCR policy will include info about acceptable counters window Client will be brought up to speed, as counter can be increased by any value TPM monotonic counter support in tpm2-tools: https://www.mankier.com/1/tpm2_nvincrement By spec, at least 3 counters per TPM, but nothing uses them anywhere Does not allow multi-boot systems, as counters would not match Tracked in TODO #14 systemd to support rollback protection with counters Shim supports Secure Boot Advanced Targeting (SBAT), stores counter in signed EFI variable, supports multiple vendors/distros.
When booting a new version, old version can be marked as invalid, as EFI variables encode component names and minimum version uses authenticated variables to store the policy (distro + version) allows multi-boot systems, and cross-vendor/downstream distributions sd-boot/sd-stub already embeds SBAT csv initrd could be covered, too, with additional optional SBAT entries TODO #15 add support for SBAT of inner UKI images (initrd), add SBAT to verity signature JSON in DDI, if kernel includes SBAT either sd-boot needs to check it through shim, or combined them in the outer UKI SBAT SBOM

\u0026ldquo;rocket surgery\u0026rdquo;, many pitfalls driver states / network queues etc. a problem, needs 100% control over hardware some HW state like TPM measurements are not resettable kexec can handle kernel w/o downtime, and w/o impacting user space CRIU to update userland? Start userland in a VM and then move userland processes using CRIU But what state CRIU migrates is opt-in, all things to carry over need to be specified explicitly systemd-suspend uses freezer cgroup to stop everything except pid1 But needs to re-arrange cgroup tree, which might break things systemd interested in hierarchical model of freezing, in which states can be passed up extend File Descriptor store so that state is persisted across kexec too (opt-in), using persistent memory, so that for a service a restart of the service or a kexec are the same userspace \u0026ldquo;reboot\u0026rdquo; (possibly with an \u0026ldquo;exitrd\u0026rdquo;, which is different from \u0026ldquo;initrd\u0026rdquo;, and resets some kernel state like /dev/), shut down everything and re-initialise to default.target, after switching to new root/usr DDI But need to figure out how to deal with TPM secrets that are phase-specific, but not different from kexec Could stop measuring after the \u0026ldquo;first\u0026rdquo; boot phases `}),e.add({id:5,href:"/docs/minutes/2023-09-12__image-based-linux-summit/",title:"2023 09 12 Image Based Linux Summit",section:"Minutes",content:" ﻿Image-Based Linux Summit Berlin 12th September 2023 # Attendee\u0026rsquo;s projects # Systemd Meta: mkosi, systemd, remote attestation SUSE: Aeon/MicroOS/Tumbleweed Redhat: image-builder/osbuild, systemd, systemd-boot Microsoft: confidential containers, flatcar, Azure Boost, Mariner Edgeless Systems: Constellation, confidential containers NixOS: systemd-{repart,stub,boot,cryptenroll}, Tvix Store, Lanzaboote, UKIs, NixOS Bootspec,, PE binary manipulation in Rust Canonical: Ubuntu Core, snaps, foundations/bootloader/package management System Transparency: UKI, UAPI specs, systemd-cryptenroll, remote attestation, TPM eventlog, mkosi Amazon Linux Freedesktop-sdk GNOME OS carbonOS Summary of Last Year’s Progress # UAPI Group established Website!

Right now at the bottom of the stack Fix it by symlinks! Always the answer AI: add ordering guarantee to sysext spec AI: rewrite config spec on uapi-group to remove XDG duplication Ideally: overlayfs mode that allows creating new files, but not modify existing files from other layers AI: Propose an extension to sysext and confext specs on uapi-group for mutable and ephemeral modes. Hermetic /etc SUSE adds support for libeconf in upstream projects apache2/nginx still need files in /etc to work, part of openssh, complex configurations files (xml or so) Fedora also has patches /efi vs /boot vs /boot/efi vs /run/efi filesystem on SUSE is rpm that creates base directories Base-files on Debian/Ubuntu Top-level directories are problematic as mountpoint for this /run ? runtime object, but solves rpm problem, also there are assumptions in systemd about resources /run Offline mounting also problematic, tools assume /run is not there before system is booted, ordering problem /run mounted by container manager/init Ideally, use automount Why do we even mount it? Because: bootctl/fwupd/kernel-install/logind(r/o) Ideally only one tool touches bootloader after all updates are applied to disk Xbootldr partition vs esp, if both available then xbootldr needs go to /boot The most important thing is where to put kernels So if xbootldr partition, then mount it on /boot If no xbootldr then ESP to /boot So kernels are always installed to /boot Places to put bootloader is not stable Bind mount or symlink, but implementers of bls need to understand this Spec for BLS: https://uapi-group.org/specifications/specs/boot_loader_specification/#mount-points Conflicts with Discoverable Partitions Spec: https://uapi-group.org/specifications/specs/discoverable_partitions_specification/ (explanation for ESP GUID table) DPS says default is /boot, BLS says /efi Tools do it the DPS way Fix BLS? /boot as default https://github.com/uapi-group/specifications/issues/35 AI: send PR and merge Tools shouldn’t mount twice /run/efi can be mount/bind mount/symlink to ESP? APIs bootctl -p or -x as API to find location of ESP Bootupd as API for grub support for BLS in Fedora Do we need new API? /dev/-by symlinks? Install kernels ‘here’, bootloader ‘here’ Still need to dedup in readers bootctl/kernel-install as multicall that can be called or provide service with varlink, works inherently with –image/–root Bootctl-varlink.socket AI Luca: open RFE on github.com/systemd/systemd Sd-boot recognizes what an EFI binary is via .sdmagic Dual boot causes a lot of problems Makes our lives complicated, do we really need it? Developers need it for hw-related development Not supposed to measure efi entries that are tried, only the one actually booted Windows: set BootNext and reboot Sd-boot supports it but only in ‘bitlocker mode’, should be made generic when switching OS UEFI has boot counter in the spec, so writing to variables should be fine Talk about AWS/Azure/GCP IMDS (early-boot link-local networking metadata server) and credentials / generators / network config Some previous discussion between Arian/Lennart: https://gist.github.com/arianvp/22e1c5182eb6c17bbd8c1bbe823b516b Networkd cloud-provider-based configuration: https://github.com/systemd/systemd/issues/16547 VBE: https://u-boot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/develop/vbe.html — alternative to UEFI for embedded systems, maybe more? NixOS looking into this, for coreboot support Specs covers boot flows, OS requests Interoperates with UEFI Other firmwares: tianocore/edk2, slimbootloader, LinuxBoot, u-boot, coreboot, SeaBIOS Emulate uefi on bios Nix has some shims to support UEFI variables Uboot can be build as bios payload, with UEFI upper layer, store variables in TPE or text files on boot partition or just leave everything volatile Google has KVM solution Clover EFI bootloader for BIOS, see configuration Question: is there a UEFI protocol to detect that persistent vars are actually ephemeral? Fedora: proposal to drop bios support, but protests, 30% of machines bios-only, still hybrid Amazon Linux 2023 has dual bios/uefi hybrid support Hybrid images: tricky to support everything because of 512/2048/4096 partition headers. mkosi tried but gave in on El Torito support. Provisioning systems for VMs SMBIOS support in sd-boot/stub Alternative: ACPI device that can send notifications SMBIOS technically is static, although one field can change at least: suspend/resume field (int) for reason of change Also data might not be ready when guest is booted SMBIOS is already supported widely ACPI needs a driver Requirement: userspace needs to ask for data and wait synchronously, don’t want to boot and then data appears later SMBIOS guarantees that data is already there ACPI can generate data on the fly when requested Systemd provides point at boot where we require data, hypervisor needs to provide it Dracut has pre-existing infrastructure on this topic Sd-stub already supports picking up resources from ESP, also reads smbios New transaction in initrd, units that generate other units Also needed to know if /root is tmpfs in installer image New targets where to hook the metadata Network namespace + VRF for cloud-init and similar to get provisioning info Amazon: provision user’s UEFI variable database Addon: PE non-code binary that can be verified by shim/uefi, append kernel command lines Credentials can be provisioned from /run in initrd to rootfs transition At the new mid-initrd target, provisioning tools prepare creds in /run Then systemd reloads and does second transition Credentials Provision SSL cert via creds Need to update it How to do it at runtime? If done live, atomicity is lost Restart service? Use FD store to keep sockets and resources order We will need conftext live reload Mount “beneath” to replace mount point atomically Can do the same for creds? We have the semantics for systemctl ‘reload-or-restart’ already We do not have good docs on fdstore Do we want an API for “Hey what services depend on what credentials so I can restart them” Future improvement: systemd-creds can encrypt to asymmetric TPM SRK so that creds can only read Let\u0026rsquo;s document $CREDENTIALS_DIRECTORY as static for system services.by confidential VM API to create/enumerate credentials is missing Sd-creds as multi-call binary with varlink service Problem: reading creds requires looking at env var, but software doesn’t like the interpolation AI Arianvp: change doc to document that creds path for system service is fixed with precise caveats and warnings to avoid being it misused sd-ask-pwd: no solution for user services More complex issue, needs integration with desktop managers Tracking issue: https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-shell/-/issues/6921 Kernel keyring has advanced lately, very complex TPM stuff Currently involves PCR11 (kernel/uki) and PCR15 (system identity) How to cover PCR 0-7 which are owned by firmware? Answer: systemd-pcrlock Instead of changing the superblock on fw update, change the policy in the TPM Attach objects to the TPM policy, when changes are expected change policy objects Disk encryption binds to policies, not measurements .pcrlock files define component involved in boot, even after fw -\u0026gt; kernel transition, json format following TCG measurement log format (but not 100% the same) Allows drop-ins and alternatives for components (eg: run multiple kernels) Generates lock files from what system measured at some point via tpm log If fwupd shipped the pcrlock file with an update then we wouldn’t need to measure on-the-fly, current LVFS stores result of pcr0, instead store measurement Only vendor can know what firmware will measure, so vendor has to provide it Pcrlock tool orders drop-ins by filenames If fwupd doesn’t know what measurements are going to be, it can remove the pcrlock drop-ins that corresponds to the component Pcrlock will recognize that there are holes, and remove that pcr/measurement from the policy If info is there, secrets are always protected If info is not there, secrets are not protected by those pcrs for one boot Improvements: reboot twice to apply changed quickly and minimize window Windows also reboots twice on unexpected fw update, but changes block device and re-enrolls in Bitlocker Can lock against firmware, can deal with firmware updates, if vendors collaborates no ‘open’ policy window Local/hw specific vs OS vendor (uki) Also solves rollback protection Recalculate automatically on reboot so that it always uses the most secure policy possible Can generate from gpt, uki, pe, current event log Trust-on-first-use model Transparent log database with pcr values of known hardware - if anything changes in the uefi (option) they change - from TCG How to recover from failure - recovery key? How to restore a usable policy? Reset TPM? Can the same recovery key for LUKS2 be used? Ubuntu Core also implements a similar infrastructure Changes the LUKS superblock on updates Can be analyzed offline Systemd has event log, that works like TCG firmware event log, for measurements done at runtime, v255 Json-seq, not array but separator-separated blocks so that it can be append-only Stored in systemd-specific dir so that it’s private Would be good to allow other usespace app can append But need atomic behaviour (file lock, append-only) Public API dbus/varlink AI Lennart: libsystemd sd_measure(⋅) which takes data and hash it for the consumer Kexec(/crashkernel): measure nonce so that it cannot be predicted and change policy, so that it works only on that kexec Ubuntu Core stores encrypted object that allows to reset the TPM on factory reset Systemd should have a hook for this Ubuntu core code: https://github.com/snapcore/secboot Non-disk-encryption usage of TPM VMs in GCP use TPM for remote attestation on container-optimized linux (fork of chromeos), not on generic linux distro, precalculate expected PCRs System Transparency ( https://www.system-transparency.org/ ): remote attestation oss project.
