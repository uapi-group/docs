# Image-Based Linux and Boot Integrity Devroom @ FOSDEM 25
The UAPI group, a community for people with an interest in innovating how we build, deploy, run, and update modern security-focused Linux operating systems, will host a devroom at FOSDEM 2025.
A "devroom" (a FOSDEM term) is a co-located mini-conference with its own separate track.

FOSDEM is an annual free event for software developers to meet, share ideas and collaborate.
It takes place on February 1 and 2 at the ULB Solbosch Campus in Brussels, Belgium.
Learn more at https://fosdem.org/2025/.

Our half-day devroom will open on Sunday morning at 9am and close at 1pm.
Drop in for talks on Image-based Linux and secure / attestable systems, and for a chat with UAPI folks.
The schedule will be [available on the FOSDEM website](https://fosdem.org/2025/schedule/track/image-based-linux/).
