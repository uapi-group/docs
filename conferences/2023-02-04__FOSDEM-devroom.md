# Image-Based Linux and Secure/Measured Boot Devroom @ FOSDEM 23
The UAPI group, a community for people with an interest in innovating how we build, deploy, run, and update modern security-focused Linux operating systems, will entertain a devroom at FOSDEM 2023.
 
FOSDEM is a free event for software developers to meet, share ideas and collaborate.
It takes place on February 4 and 5 at the ULB Solbosch Campus in Brussels, Belgium.

Our half-day devroom will open on Saturday morning and close at noon.
Drop in for talks on Image-based Linux and secure / attestable systems, and for a chat with UAPI folks.
