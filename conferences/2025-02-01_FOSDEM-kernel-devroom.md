# Kernel Devroom @ FOSDEM 25

We are pleased to announce the Call for Participation (CfP) for the FOSDEM 2025 Kernel Devroom.

FOSDEM 2025 will be over the weekend of the 1st and 2nd of February in Brussels, Belgium.
FOSDEM is a free and non-commercial event organised by the community for the community.
The goal is to provide free and open source software developers and communities a place to meet to:

- get in touch with other developers and projects;
- be informed about the latest developments in the free software world;
- be informed about the latest developments in the open source world;
- attend interesting talks and presentations on various topics by project leaders and committers;
- to promote the development and benefits of free software and open source solutions.
- Participation and attendance is totally free, though the organisers gratefully accept donations and sponsorship.

## Format

The Kernel Devroom will be running an all day, exact day and time will be clarified in the near future..

Weâ€™re looking for talk or demo proposals in one of the following 4 sizes:

- 10 minutes (e.g., a short demo)
- 20 minutes (e.g., a project update)
- 30 minutes (e.g., introduction to a new technology or a deep dive on a complex feature)
- 40 minutes (e.g., a deep dive on a complex feature)

In all cases, please allow for at least 5 minutes of questions (10min preferred for the 30min slots).
In general, shorter content will be more likely to get approved as we want to cover a wide range of topics.
