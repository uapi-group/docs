# Kernel <-> Userspace/Init/System Management boundaries and APIs MicroConference @ LPC 24

We are pleased to announce the Call for Participation (CfP) for the [LPC 2024](https://lpc.events/)
Kernel <-> Userspace/Init/System Management boundaries and APIs MicroConference.

LPC 2024 will be held in Vienna, Austria, September 18th to 20th 2024.

The focus of this microconference will be on topics related to the APIs and interfaces sitting at
the boundary between the kernel and init systems/system management layers, with a special attention
directed towards current pain points and omissions.

For example, issues around the current way initrd are loaded and set up between the bootloader and
the kernel as we move towards immutable systems, or the interfaces provided by the kernel around the
mount or cgroup or pidfd APIs as consumed by systemd or other service managers, or the uevent
interactions between the kernel and udev.

## Topics and Format

We expect submissions to be either open discussions or presentations that discuss new proposals/ideas,
ongoing work, or problems we are/should be solving in this space. Submissions are recommended to be
20 or 40 minutes long. Please specify the format and the desired length of your submission.

Please allow for at least 5 minutes of questions (10min preferred for the 40min slots).

## Proposals

Proposals should be sent through the LPC scheduling system at: https://lpc.events/event/18/abstracts/

Please select the "Kernel <-> Userspace/Init/System Management boundaries and APIs MC" as the __track__.

__The CfP deadline is Friday, 5 July 2024.__
