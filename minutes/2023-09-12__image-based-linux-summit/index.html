Right now at the bottom of the stack Fix it by symlinks! Always the answer AI: add ordering guarantee to sysext spec AI: rewrite config spec on uapi-group to remove XDG duplication Ideally: overlayfs mode that allows creating new files, but not modify existing files from other layers AI: Propose an extension to sysext and confext specs on uapi-group for mutable and ephemeral modes. Hermetic /etc SUSE adds support for libeconf in upstream projects apache2/nginx still need files in /etc to work, part of openssh, complex configurations files (xml or so) Fedora also has patches /efi vs /boot vs /boot/efi vs /run/efi filesystem on SUSE is rpm that creates base directories Base-files on Debian/Ubuntu Top-level directories are problematic as mountpoint for this /run ? runtime object, but solves rpm problem, also there are assumptions in systemd about resources /run Offline mounting also problematic, tools assume /run is not there before system is booted, ordering problem /run mounted by container manager/init Ideally, use automount Why do we even mount it? Because: bootctl/fwupd/kernel-install/logind(r/o) Ideally only one tool touches bootloader after all updates are applied to disk Xbootldr partition vs esp, if both available then xbootldr needs go to /boot The most important thing is where to put kernels So if xbootldr partition, then mount it on /boot If no xbootldr then ESP to /boot So kernels are always installed to /boot Places to put bootloader is not stable Bind mount or symlink, but implementers of bls need to understand this Spec for BLS: https://uapi-group.org/specifications/specs/boot_loader_specification/#mount-points Conflicts with Discoverable Partitions Spec: https://uapi-group.org/specifications/specs/discoverable_partitions_specification/ (explanation for ESP GUID table) DPS says default is /boot, BLS says /efi Tools do it the DPS way Fix BLS? /boot as default https://github.com/uapi-group/specifications/issues/35 AI: send PR and merge Tools shouldn’t mount twice /run/efi can be mount/bind mount/symlink to ESP? APIs bootctl -p or -x as API to find location of ESP Bootupd as API for grub support for BLS in Fedora Do we need new API? /dev/-by symlinks? Install kernels ‘here’, bootloader ‘here’ Still need to dedup in readers bootctl/kernel-install as multicall that can be called or provide service with varlink, works inherently with –image/–root Bootctl-varlink.socket AI Luca: open RFE on github.com/systemd/systemd Sd-boot recognizes what an EFI binary is via .sdmagic Dual boot causes a lot of problems Makes our lives complicated, do we really need it? Developers need it for hw-related development Not supposed to measure efi entries that are tried, only the one actually booted Windows: set BootNext and reboot Sd-boot supports it but only in ‘bitlocker mode’, should be made generic when switching OS UEFI has boot counter in the spec, so writing to variables should be fine Talk about AWS/Azure/GCP IMDS (early-boot link-local networking metadata server) and credentials / generators / network config Some previous discussion between Arian/Lennart: https://gist.github.com/arianvp/22e1c5182eb6c17bbd8c1bbe823b516b Networkd cloud-provider-based configuration: https://github.com/systemd/systemd/issues/16547 VBE: https://u-boot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/develop/vbe.html — alternative to UEFI for embedded systems, maybe more? NixOS looking into this, for coreboot support Specs covers boot flows, OS requests Interoperates with UEFI Other firmwares: tianocore/edk2, slimbootloader, LinuxBoot, u-boot, coreboot, SeaBIOS Emulate uefi on bios Nix has some shims to support UEFI variables Uboot can be build as bios payload, with UEFI upper layer, store variables in TPE or text files on boot partition or just leave everything volatile Google has KVM solution Clover EFI bootloader for BIOS, see configuration Question: is there a UEFI protocol to detect that persistent vars are actually ephemeral? Fedora: proposal to drop bios support, but protests, 30% of machines bios-only, still hybrid Amazon Linux 2023 has dual bios/uefi hybrid support Hybrid images: tricky to support everything because of 512/2048/4096 partition headers. mkosi tried but gave in on El Torito support. Provisioning systems for VMs SMBIOS support in sd-boot/stub Alternative: ACPI device that can send notifications SMBIOS technically is static, although one field can change at least: suspend/resume field (int) for reason of change Also data might not be ready when guest is booted SMBIOS is already supported widely ACPI needs a driver Requirement: userspace needs to ask for data and wait synchronously, don’t want to boot and then data appears later SMBIOS guarantees that data is already there ACPI can generate data on the fly when requested Systemd provides point at boot where we require data, hypervisor needs to provide it Dracut has pre-existing infrastructure on this topic Sd-stub already supports picking up resources from ESP, also reads smbios New transaction in initrd, units that generate other units Also needed to know if /root is tmpfs in installer image New targets where to hook the metadata Network namespace + VRF for cloud-init and similar to get provisioning info Amazon: provision user’s UEFI variable database Addon: PE non-code binary that can be verified by shim/uefi, append kernel command lines Credentials can be provisioned from /run in initrd to rootfs transition At the new mid-initrd target, provisioning tools prepare creds in /run Then systemd reloads and does second transition Credentials Provision SSL cert via creds Need to update it How to do it at runtime? If done live, atomicity is lost Restart service? Use FD store to keep sockets and resources order We will need conftext live reload Mount “beneath” to replace mount point atomically Can do the same for creds? We have the semantics for systemctl ‘reload-or-restart’ already We do not have good docs on fdstore Do we want an API for “Hey what services depend on what credentials so I can restart them” Future improvement: systemd-creds can encrypt to asymmetric TPM SRK so that creds can only read Let’s document $CREDENTIALS_DIRECTORY as static for system services.by confidential VM API to create/enumerate credentials is missing Sd-creds as multi-call binary with varlink service Problem: reading creds requires looking at env var, but software doesn’t like the interpolation AI Arianvp: change doc to document that creds path for system service is fixed with precise caveats and warnings to avoid being it misused sd-ask-pwd: no solution for user services More complex issue, needs integration with desktop managers Tracking issue: https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-shell/-/issues/6921 Kernel keyring has advanced lately, very complex TPM stuff Currently involves PCR11 (kernel/uki) and PCR15 (system identity) How to cover PCR 0-7 which are owned by firmware? Answer: systemd-pcrlock Instead of changing the superblock on fw update, change the policy in the TPM Attach objects to the TPM policy, when changes are expected change policy objects Disk encryption binds to policies, not measurements .pcrlock files define component involved in boot, even after fw -> kernel transition, json format following TCG measurement log format (but not 100% the same) Allows drop-ins and alternatives for components (eg: run multiple kernels) Generates lock files from what system measured at some point via tpm log If fwupd shipped the pcrlock file with an update then we wouldn’t need to measure on-the-fly, current LVFS stores result of pcr0, instead store measurement Only vendor can know what firmware will measure, so vendor has to provide it Pcrlock tool orders drop-ins by filenames If fwupd doesn’t know what measurements are going to be, it can remove the pcrlock drop-ins that corresponds to the component Pcrlock will recognize that there are holes, and remove that pcr/measurement from the policy If info is there, secrets are always protected If info is not there, secrets are not protected by those pcrs for one boot Improvements: reboot twice to apply changed quickly and minimize window Windows also reboots twice on unexpected fw update, but changes block device and re-enrolls in Bitlocker Can lock against firmware, can deal with firmware updates, if vendors collaborates no ‘open’ policy window Local/hw specific vs OS vendor (uki) Also solves rollback protection Recalculate automatically on reboot so that it always uses the most secure policy possible Can generate from gpt, uki, pe, current event log Trust-on-first-use model Transparent log database with pcr values of known hardware - if anything changes in the uefi (option) they change - from TCG How to recover from failure - recovery key? How to restore a usable policy? Reset TPM? Can the same recovery key for LUKS2 be used? Ubuntu Core also implements a similar infrastructure Changes the LUKS superblock on updates Can be analyzed offline Systemd has event log, that works like TCG firmware event log, for measurements done at runtime, v255 Json-seq, not array but separator-separated blocks so that it can be append-only Stored in systemd-specific dir so that it’s private Would be good to allow other usespace app can append But need atomic behaviour (file lock, append-only) Public API dbus/varlink AI Lennart: libsystemd sd_measure(⋅) which takes data and hash it for the consumer Kexec(/crashkernel): measure nonce so that it cannot be predicted and change policy, so that it works only on that kexec Ubuntu Core stores encrypted object that allows to reset the TPM on factory reset Systemd should have a hook for this Ubuntu core code: https://github.com/snapcore/secboot Non-disk-encryption usage of TPM VMs in GCP use TPM for remote attestation on container-optimized linux (fork of chromeos), not on generic linux distro, precalculate expected PCRs System Transparency (https://www.system-transparency.org/ ): remote attestation oss project. Code https://git.glasklar.is/system-transparency/core Attested TLS: developed for SGX - standardization happening, RATS, remote attestation for TLS Bind confidential computing to remote attestation Keylime uses TPM for remote attestation, integrated in MicroOS Talos does Build reproducibility helps for build systems attestation, but it is expensive, so many prefer attestation/authentication as an alternative Confidential computing Amd sev vs intel tdx, amd uses tpm Full vm confidential comp vs kata containers, but still needs measured boot In Azure firmware does measurements in vTPM Thread models driven by soc - intel/amd - no common specification Unified kernels + pre-built initrd Pass initrd via PE binary, lose ordering guarantees because filenames are not trusted Dtb addon patch adds matching based on content of dtb .mucode for microcode section in UKI, and magically make it first in the generated cpio Systemd-sysusers and user users A switch will be added to copy /etc/skel Can also drop json blob for userdbd to pick up in /run/ for transient user user, never show up in /etc/passwd → also great for hermetic /usr with json blobs in /usr/lib/userdb/ pam_mkhomedir can also create the directory on first login Homed in openSUSE Aeon: many papercuts, mainly storage burden Need to know a lot of stuff for provisioning ahead of time (like number of users) Encrypted btrfs subvolume as a solution, don’t need to know size ahead of time Lots of work going on in Gnome, lock session and remove disk keys from memory Interactive resizing negotiating between users if disk needs to change (owner user will be authenticated and asked to agree) SELinux policy for homed needs a little work Fedora actively fixes systemd selinux issues if they are reported with logs Some users in Nix also use homed, but with fixed user, also on Fedora there are some users but unofficial Ongoing work in Gnome is to make it trivial to enable homed in distros How to split space between /home and rootfs New partition type in repart using dm-linear to add an extension for another partition on-the-fly Android uses it, no measurable performance penalties for having many dm-linear extensions / as opal encrypted (cryptsetup will support in next version with LUKS2 for keys), then homed LUKS2+dm-crypt loopback q devices Homed could use creds for initial setup Sysusers runs much earlier, homed need a lot of stuff set up, runs very late Why not just use ZFS?

Answer: systemd-pcrlock Instead of changing the superblock on fw update, change the policy in the TPM Attach objects to the TPM policy, when changes are expected change policy objects Disk encryption binds to policies, not measurements .pcrlock files define component involved in boot, even after fw -> kernel transition, json format following TCG measurement log format (but not 100% the same) Allows drop-ins and alternatives for components (eg: run multiple kernels) Generates lock files from what system measured at some point via tpm log If fwupd shipped the pcrlock file with an update then we wouldn’t need to measure on-the-fly, current LVFS stores result of pcr0, instead store measurement Only vendor can know what firmware will measure, so vendor has to provide it Pcrlock tool orders drop-ins by filenames If fwupd doesn’t know what measurements are going to be, it can remove the pcrlock drop-ins that corresponds to the component Pcrlock will recognize that there are holes, and remove that pcr/measurement from the policy If info is there, secrets are always protected If info is not there, secrets are not protected by those pcrs for one boot Improvements: reboot twice to apply changed quickly and minimize window Windows also reboots twice on unexpected fw update, but changes block device and re-enrolls in Bitlocker Can lock against firmware, can deal with firmware updates, if vendors collaborates no ‘open’ policy window Local/hw specific vs OS vendor (uki) Also solves rollback protection Recalculate automatically on reboot so that it always uses the most secure policy possible Can generate from gpt, uki, pe, current event log Trust-on-first-use model Transparent log database with pcr values of known hardware - if anything changes in the uefi (option) they change - from TCG How to recover from failure - recovery key? How to restore a usable policy? Reset TPM? Can the same recovery key for LUKS2 be used? Ubuntu Core also implements a similar infrastructure Changes the LUKS superblock on updates Can be analyzed offline Systemd has event log, that works like TCG firmware event log, for measurements done at runtime, v255 Json-seq, not array but separator-separated blocks so that it can be append-only Stored in systemd-specific dir so that it’s private Would be good to allow other usespace app can append But need atomic behaviour (file lock, append-only) Public API dbus/varlink AI Lennart: libsystemd sd_measure(⋅) which takes data and hash it for the consumer Kexec(/crashkernel): measure nonce so that it cannot be predicted and change policy, so that it works only on that kexec Ubuntu Core stores encrypted object that allows to reset the TPM on factory reset Systemd should have a hook for this Ubuntu core code: https://github.com/snapcore/secboot Non-disk-encryption usage of TPM VMs in GCP use TPM for remote attestation on container-optimized linux (fork of chromeos), not on generic linux distro, precalculate expected PCRs System Transparency (https://www.system-transparency.org/ ): remote attestation oss project.

Hermetic /etc SUSE adds support for libeconf in upstream projects apache2/nginx still need files in /etc to work, part of openssh, complex configurations files (xml or so) Fedora also has patches /efi vs /boot vs /boot/efi vs /run/efi filesystem on SUSE is rpm that creates base directories Base-files on Debian/Ubuntu Top-level directories are problematic as mountpoint for this /run ? runtime object, but solves rpm problem, also there are assumptions in systemd about resources /run Offline mounting also problematic, tools assume /run is not there before system is booted, ordering problem /run mounted by container manager/init Ideally, use automount Why do we even mount it? Because: bootctl/fwupd/kernel-install/logind(r/o) Ideally only one tool touches bootloader after all updates are applied to disk Xbootldr partition vs esp, if both available then xbootldr needs go to /boot The most important thing is where to put kernels So if xbootldr partition, then mount it on /boot If no xbootldr then ESP to /boot So kernels are always installed to /boot Places to put bootloader is not stable Bind mount or symlink, but implementers of bls need to understand this Spec for BLS: https://uapi-group.org/specifications/specs/boot_loader_specification/#mount-points Conflicts with Discoverable Partitions Spec: https://uapi-group.org/specifications/specs/discoverable_partitions_specification/ (explanation for ESP GUID table) DPS says default is /boot, BLS says /efi Tools do it the DPS way Fix BLS? /boot as default https://github.com/uapi-group/specifications/issues/35 AI: send PR and merge Tools shouldn’t mount twice /run/efi can be mount/bind mount/symlink to ESP?

Developers need it for hw-related development Not supposed to measure efi entries that are tried, only the one actually booted Windows: set BootNext and reboot Sd-boot supports it but only in ‘bitlocker mode’, should be made generic when switching OS UEFI has boot counter in the spec, so writing to variables should be fine Talk about AWS/Azure/GCP IMDS (early-boot link-local networking metadata server) and credentials / generators / network config Some previous discussion between Arian/Lennart: https://gist.github.com/arianvp/22e1c5182eb6c17bbd8c1bbe823b516b Networkd cloud-provider-based configuration: https://github.com/systemd/systemd/issues/16547 VBE: https://u-boot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/develop/vbe.html — alternative to UEFI for embedded systems, maybe more? NixOS looking into this, for coreboot support Specs covers boot flows, OS requests Interoperates with UEFI Other firmwares: tianocore/edk2, slimbootloader, LinuxBoot, u-boot, coreboot, SeaBIOS Emulate uefi on bios Nix has some shims to support UEFI variables Uboot can be build as bios payload, with UEFI upper layer, store variables in TPE or text files on boot partition or just leave everything volatile Google has KVM solution Clover EFI bootloader for BIOS, see configuration Question: is there a UEFI protocol to detect that persistent vars are actually ephemeral? Fedora: proposal to drop bios support, but protests, 30% of machines bios-only, still hybrid Amazon Linux 2023 has dual bios/uefi hybrid support Hybrid images: tricky to support everything because of 512/2048/4096 partition headers. mkosi tried but gave in on El Torito support. Provisioning systems for VMs SMBIOS support in sd-boot/stub Alternative: ACPI device that can send notifications SMBIOS technically is static, although one field can change at least: suspend/resume field (int) for reason of change Also data might not be ready when guest is booted SMBIOS is already supported widely ACPI needs a driver Requirement: userspace needs to ask for data and wait synchronously, don’t want to boot and then data appears later SMBIOS guarantees that data is already there ACPI can generate data on the fly when requested Systemd provides point at boot where we require data, hypervisor needs to provide it Dracut has pre-existing infrastructure on this topic Sd-stub already supports picking up resources from ESP, also reads smbios New transaction in initrd, units that generate other units Also needed to know if /root is tmpfs in installer image New targets where to hook the metadata Network namespace + VRF for cloud-init and similar to get provisioning info Amazon: provision user’s UEFI variable database Addon: PE non-code binary that can be verified by shim/uefi, append kernel command lines Credentials can be provisioned from /run in initrd to rootfs transition At the new mid-initrd target, provisioning tools prepare creds in /run Then systemd reloads and does second transition Credentials Provision SSL cert via creds Need to update it How to do it at runtime?
